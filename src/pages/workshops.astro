      <h2>Workshops That Support Real Work</h2>
      <p>
        Trifolium’s workshops are designed for professionals who build things
        that matter. Whether you work in interiors, architecture, prototyping,
        or fabrication, we aim to cover your full production needs.
        <br /><br />
        With dedicated spaces for wood, metal, textiles, electronics, and model-making,
        plus access to digital tools and training, everything you need is right here—under
        one roof.

    <p>
      Our wood workshop is one of the central hubs of Trifolium. It’s set up to
      support everything from precision joinery and furniture to fast
      prototyping and custom installations.
    </p>

    </div>
    <p>
      The space is laid out to keep things flowing—whether you're running a solo
      build or coordinating with a team. Workbenches, industrial machinery, and
      open layout make it easy to focus and execute at a professional level.
      <br /><br />
      It’s the go-to workshop for carpenters, designers, set builders, and anyone
      working seriously with timber and wood-based materials. Whether you work in
      rough cuts or refined details, you’ll find the tools and room to do it right.

    <p>
      The metal workshop is where structure, function, and fire come together.
      This space supports welding, cutting, bending, and light-to-medium
      fabrication work across various metals.

    </div>
    <p>
      It’s a versatile environment for people working in furniture, installation
      design, mechanical structures, or prototyping that calls for more strength
      and precision.
      <br /><br />
      The layout makes it easy to move between tasks without friction. If your work
      involves steel, aluminum, or similar materials, this is where your build starts
      to take shape.

    <p>
      The model workshop is where ideas get tested, scaled, and shaped by hand.

      This is a quieter, more controlled space for professionals who work at
      smaller scales or need a clean environment for delicate processes.
      <br /><br />
      Architects, product designers, and concept developers use this workshop to
      bridge the gap between screen and object. It’s a space made for focus, detail,
      and experimentation.

      Need space to store your materials or ongoing work? We offer shelf storage
      and floor space at monthly rates, priced by the square meter. Whether you
      need a small spot or a bigger footprint, you can keep your tools and
      projects close by and ready to go.

    <h2>Digital Fabrication & Learning Access</h2>
    <p>
      Digital fabrication is a core part of what we do at Trifolium. From CNC
      milling and laser cutting to digital model workflows, we support both
      self-driven professionals and those learning new tools.
      <br /><br />
      Our Design & Production team is specialized in digital fabrication and helps
      push what’s possible across projects and materials.
      <br /><br />
      To ensure everyone works safely and efficiently, certain machines require an
      introduction course before use. We offer training for all our key machines,
      so you can level up while you work.

      Trifolium is a shared space full of professionals with different skills,

      <br /><br />
      People here talk shop, trade knowledge, help each other, and build smarter
      through community. Whether you work solo or in a team, you’ll feel the benefit
      of being surrounded by others who get what it takes to bring real projects
      to life.

    <h2>The Mobile Production Unit (MPU)</h2>
    <p>
      Sometimes the job happens off-site. The Mobile Production Unit is a
      compact, high-spec workshop container you can book when you need
      production on location—or just need access to tools without a full
      membership.
      <br /><br />
      It’s perfect for temporary builds, short-term access to digital tools like
      CNC machines, or site-specific setups. If you're working remote but still want
      professional-grade capabilities, the MPU rolls up ready to go.
