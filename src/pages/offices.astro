      <h2>Workspaces That Fit the Way You Work</h2>
      <p>
        At Trifolium, we offer a range of professional office spaces designed to
        match your workflow. Whether you need a private room for your team or
        prefer being part of a vibrant, open studio environment, we’ve got you
        covered. Our offices are built for flexibility, so you can scale up or
        down as your needs change.

      <h2>Closed Offices for Focused Teams</h2>
      <p>
        Our private office spaces are ideal for teams who need a quieter, more
        contained setting. These rooms accommodate 4 to 6 people and are located
        in a calm hallway separate from the open studio area. They offer a
        professional, low-distraction environment with the benefits of being
        part of a larger, creative workspace just outside the door. Perfect for
        companies who value privacy but still want access to a wider community
        and shared resources.

      <h2>Open Platform Offices in the Studio Village</h2>
      <p>
        Situated in the heart of the building, our open studio workspaces offer
        direct access to workshops, meeting rooms, and shared amenities. Here,
        you sit alongside other professionals in a dynamic, day-to-day
        production environment. It’s ideal for those who thrive in a
        collaborative setting and want to stay close to the action. You bring
        your desk setup, and we provide the space, context, and community to
        support your work.

      <h2>Flex Desks with Full Access</h2>
      <p>
        For those who don’t need a permanent setup, our flex desk option offers
        freedom without compromise. You can drop in, find your spot in the open
        studio zone, and get to work. It’s the perfect solution if you want to
        stay connected to the Trifolium community while keeping things light and
        flexible. With access to all shared areas and facilities, you still get
        the full experience. Just on your own terms.

      <h2>Work Alone, Never Isolated</h2>
      <p>
        Trifolium is more than a workplace. It’s a professional community built
        on sharing knowledge, tools, and momentum. Whether you're grabbing lunch
        in the kitchen, running into someone in the workshop, or joining a
        member-led event, there are constant opportunities to connect. We
        believe the best work happens when people exchange ideas across
        industries, disciplines, and experiences.
