      <h2>Closed Offices for Focused Teams</h2>
      <p>
        Our private office spaces are ideal for teams who need a quieter, more contained setting. These rooms accommodate 4 to 6 people and are located in a calm hallway separate from the open studio area. They offer a professional, low-distraction
        environment with the benefits of being part of a larger, creative workspace just outside the door. Perfect for companies who value privacy but still want access to a wider community and shared resources.

      <h2>Flex Desks with Full Access</h2>
      <p>
        For those who don’t need a permanent setup, our flex desk option offers freedom without compromise. You can drop in, find your spot in the open studio zone, and get to work. It’s the perfect solution if you want to stay connected to the
        Trifolium community while keeping things light and flexible. With access to all shared areas and facilities, you still get the full experience. Just on your own terms.

      <h2>Work Alone, Never Isolated</h2>
      <p>
        Trifolium is more than a workplace. It’s a professional community built on sharing knowledge, tools, and momentum. Whether you're grabbing lunch in the kitchen, running into someone in the workshop, or joining a member-led event, there are
        constant opportunities to connect. We believe the best work happens when people exchange ideas across industries, disciplines, and experiences.
